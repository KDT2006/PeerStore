# foreverstore-go

## Description
**foreverstore-go** is a fully distributed storage system built in Go, leveraging a custom peer-to-peer (P2P) library implemented over TCP. This project facilitates secure and efficient storage, retrieval, and deletion(TODO) of files within a decentralized network, with built-in encryption for data protection.

## Features
- **Distributed Storage**: Files are stored across multiple nodes in a peer-to-peer network, ensuring redundancy and availability.
- **Secure Uploading and Fetching**: All files are encrypted using a custom encryption key, providing robust security.
- **Custom P2P Library**: A custom-built peer-to-peer library over TCP, allowing seamless communication between nodes.
